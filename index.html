         <p> I was born in Cape Town on the 25th of August, 1989. <br>
             my family moved to Johannesburg when I was 6 years old and <br>
             I have stayed in Johannesburg ever since. I enjoyed growing up <br>
             in Joburg, I made lots of friends. After I finished school at Sacred Heart College <br>
              in 2007 I worked as a DJ and also had some other odd jobs. When I heard about Quirky 30 i thought it <br>
             would be a great way to update my CV and make me more desirable to the job market <br>
             so I came to Cape Town in the beginning of 2020 to start the course, and I have been <br>
             enjoying myself since.

           <h3>LEARNING HABITS</h3>
           <p>When it comes to working I am a very dertermined worker who tries to get work done. <br>
              I also work best by trial and error. allowing myself to make mistakes gives me the <br>
              opportunity to learn from those mistakes and improve my skills. I also work well in <br>
              in groups and make sure to get my share of the work done.</p>

                <h3>GOALS</h3>

             <p><i>'Mystery creates wonder, and wonder is the basis of man's <br>
              desire to understand' - Neil Armstrong</i></p>


              <p>This quote by Neil Armstrong defines me most accurately and <br>
                 outlines my goals. First, I want to help people in a real way <br>
                 to achieve not only their goals but help their personal growth. <br>
                 Secondly, I want to reach my personal goal of being self employed <br>
                 which I think will help my first goal which is to help disenfranchised <br>
                 people. I would also like to become more open-minded and be more open to <br>
                 learning from individual people as opposed to the technical ways of teaching <br>
                 and learning. Lastly, I would like to complete a Phd and use it to become respected <br>
                 in the academic field for reaching out to disadvantaged people.</p>

                   <h3>FRUSTRATIONS</h3>
                   <p>I don't have a lot of frustrations but to list one or two it would be that I <br>
                      don't have patients for people who don't want to learn. Secondy, I am impatient. <br>
                      I wish I could be more patient with myself an other people.</p>
